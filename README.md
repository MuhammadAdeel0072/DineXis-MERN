# 🌑 AK-7 REST — Midnight Gourmet

**A Premium, Full-Stack Dining Experience meticulously crafted for the digital age.**

AK-7 REST is a luxury restaurant management ecosystem built on the **MERN** stack. It combines cutting-edge performance with a bespoke "**Midnight Gourmet**" aesthetic to deliver a seamless, high-end experience across three specialized front-end modules—Client, Admin, and Chef—all powered by a robust, real-time Backend Server.

## 💎 The "Midnight Gourmet" Identity

The system is designed around a premium visual language ensuring a spectacular user experience across all modules:
- **Luxury Aesthetic**: A deep charcoal canvas accented with brushed gold and crimson highlights.
- **Glassmorphism**: UI components utilize high-end backdrop blurs and tacranslucent borders for deep visual immersion.
- **Dynamic Micro-interactions**: Powered by `framer-motion`, every interaction—from menu selection to checkout to drag-and-drop order management—feels fluid, responsive, and alive.
- **Sharp Iconography**: Consistent and minimalist icons using `lucide-react` for a state-of-the-art look.
